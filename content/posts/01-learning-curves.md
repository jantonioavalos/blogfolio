_Feel comfortable with being uncomfortable_, has been converted in a buzzy pray, although **getting that level of confidence isn’t just a loud practice in the mirror, but a process!**

It requires us to embrace those feelings of fear and those thoughts of failure. How? As a matter of fact, **being constantly exposed!**Because no matter how many books about self-esteem you read or how many courses on any subject you take if you don’t put yourself into action, **lack of confidence will always follow you**. 👻 😨

### **1️⃣So… Let’s get used to it**

**That feeling seems to never end**, it’s not that big but there’s always this feeling before performing that action you were supposed to know. Even when you have already studied or have asked about everything, **you’ll have more complex situations to prove yourself in the future** or higher standards in your mind.

Right now, I’m writing this post about it, and I can even hear that perfectionist voice inside that tells me I should study more things before writing, but now I do know **this is just practice for better work and to a greater good**that I have planned. 📈 🙏 So, trust in the big picture!

**Feeling scared or justified with unhealthy perfectionism is perfectly normal**in new situations or when we have had a previous bad experience. But we can learn how to perform that knowledge if we put some effort into practicing. Just as [Tim Ferris](https://tim.blog/)explains with long documented cases of his life on his [TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_ferriss_smash_fear_learn_anything).

Consider this, It’s impossible to know everything and even the wiser and [successful people have a track record of failures](https://www.businessinsider.com/successful-people-who-failed-at-first-2015-7).

### **2️⃣Don’t compare yourself with other people**

Nowadays we’re very used to see just the success of people by the social networks, but often we forget **that’s the happy face they want us to see**and in the other hand, **we usually don’t look into the past sacrifices behind**those moments of success.

When I was head of projects for a small non-profit (that I co-founded to educate more responsible citizen) **I used to feel ashamed in events**with other larger organizations because we only had 3 active projects (Radio show, Conferences Program, and a Human behavior research) I thought that was not enough, or even faking. But**I was forgetting the fact that I was actually selected to be part of those events by people who admired our work**and also ignoring the years of learning and the number of hands involved on those big organizations, **comparing us was really out of sense! 🙅 😅**

**Forgetting about our worth is something common**when we keep comparing our efforts versus other people’s success. This fact is constantly mentioned in the [Six steps to overcoming imposter syndrome by Bill Carmody -Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2018/07/27/six-steps-to-overcoming-imposter-syndrome/#20cb05d93152). So…

### **3️⃣Learn one by one**

Any learning curve is always a challenge because we usually aren’t learning just a thing, **like any discipline, there is some other knowledge involved** in the process. So, why do we complicate it? **Let’s combine similar knowledge so each minute of practice can reinforce**the learning process.

As part of my activities as an Intern at Intel, I had to study the essentials of many technologies, documenting solutionsfor common problems in the test’s platforms.

At that time, I was really excited to learn to play the violin I recently bought, all this continuing my usual readings about psychology and by the way, continuing my University Classes, so **It was insane having such as different areas of knowledge!**😵🔫

> You have to face it, you cannot learn everything -at the same time.

So, **putting some order**on what area can be learned first to understand better the other areas is really helpful. Plus, prioritizing by what’s best to know for this life’s moment. **Understanding why you really need that and how would you feel once you get that certain expertize level helps a lot to that classification!**

### **4️⃣Make your activities focus on your learning**

Guide all your hobbies to support your learning: Watching movies, reading, listening to podcasts, do all about that topic, **even playing video games or spending time in social networks can make you feel more comfortable**with the jargon and practicing that new knowledge.

Late last year in my job, we started implementing React.JS to deliver a much better user experience in our website. Since I’m still a newbie in Front-end Development **I had a hard time learning that in the go and adapting to SCRUM style, so**even though I speak and write well for a public, I struggled with it in English as my second language, so it was hard to keep my personal communication style on emails, being confident in the code review’s and daily stand up’s meetings.😐 👌

> Instead of having a mix of books and courses we can take advantage of our hobbies!

Watching instructive videos instead of another Netflix chapter. Changing radio to listening to a podcast with the experts on the matter in our way to the office. Reading articles from online communities instead of reading silly texts from social media or **even following the right people if we cannot stop scrolling down our twitter’s feed can help.**

But if you struggle with having this kind of supporting hobbies, take a look at the Google’s Engineer Matt Cutts’s Ted Talk about forming habits and you can have fun while you form a habit for your learning curve!

### **5️⃣Prove what you learned**

Talking to your friends about that growing passion **helps you to mental review that knowledge** and that’s even better if you try to teach them that new thing you learned,**turning a boring conversation at the cafeteria into an intro class**. That will make you feel confident talking about the topic.

Last year, I started a group with friends to meet each Saturday’s afternoon in a different cafe on the city, **just to talk about whatever we read in the week**: articles, novels, non-fiction books, courses. That was just an excuse to having us practicing and **besides the fact we met more often, we discovered interesting places around. Try it! ☕️📚**

**Listening to other people who are learning even when they’re not exactly accurate can help to see that everybody is in a learning curve,** your current state is just natural, nobody is expert at everything. Every person has lived different paths and that gives a unique vision of the things that can be helpful for many people or even the trigger that someone just needed.

### The Takeaway…

![img](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*DVPd6jC7wXyfiI2P-kBY8Q.jpeg)

The most important thing is **discovering how you learn.** That will give you the confidence to learn anything and the sureness **that fear is just the Foreword of any new experience.**

As said before, maybe you need a quick video with the _essentials_ to see things at a high level or maybe a podcast with the experts to figure the big picture out. Listening lessons while exercising or mediate before taking classes. Who knows?!

> Experimenting different ways of learning with different resources is good, but finding the way to **adapt learning**to your daily routine is the best! 🏆
